Cloning Caliana - Operator Mobile App
This repository contains the solution for the assignment to clone the Caliana Operator Mobile App as instructed.

Features
UI Cloning: The main objective was to replicate the UI as closely as possible to the original.

Adjustments:

Icons: Some icons couldn't be matched exactly due to the lack of access to the original assets. Iâ€™ve used similar alternatives where necessary.

Padding & Alignment: Minor adjustments were made to the padding and spacing in some parts of the UI to improve consistency and alignment.

Setup
1. Clone the repository:
  git clone https://github.com/Jeee7/caliana-clone.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd caliana-clone

3. Install dependencies:
  flutter pub get

4. Run the app:
  flutter run

Notes
- This project may contain some minor differences from the original in terms of padding, icons, and minor layout adjustments.
- Flutter Version: This project was developed using Flutter 3.24.3. Please ensure you're using the same version for consistency.
- FVM Usage: I am using Flutter Version Manager (FVM) for flexibility across multiple projects with different Flutter versions. This project is using Flutter 3.24.3 and Dart SDK 3.5.3.
